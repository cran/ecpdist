Description: Computes the Extended Chen-Poisson (ecp) distribution, survival, 
    density, hazard, cumulative hazard and quantile functions. It also allows 
    to generate a pseudo-random sample from this distribution. The corresponding 
    graphics are available. Functions to obtain measures of skewness and 
    kurtosis, k-th raw moments, conditional k-th moments and mean 
    residual life function were added. For details about ecp distribution, see 
    Sousa-Ferreira, I., Abreu, A.M. & Rocha, C. (2023).
