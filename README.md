# ecpdist

`ecpdist` is a package that computes the values of the cumulative
distribution, survival, density, hazard, cumulative hazard and quantile
functions of the Extended Chen-Poisson Lifetime Distribution. The
corresponding graphics are now available. Functions to obtain measures
of skewness and kurtosis, k-th raw moments, conditional k-th moments and
mean residual life function were added. Some more functions can appear
soon!
